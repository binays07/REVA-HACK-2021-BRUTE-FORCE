We, team "BRUTE FORCE" have created an augmented reality-based application named "ARyas!!" for making learning easy and fun. Using our application, students can view their 2-D images in the textbooks as 3-D objects in Augmented Reality. We have created 3-D objects for subjects like Biology, Chemistry, EVS, Physics, etc. By doing this they can get a better view of the 2-D objects and can understand theoretical concepts better.
